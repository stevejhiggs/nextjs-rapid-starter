# Api

Next supports [api endpoints](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) allowing you to easily create the apis you need. These endpoints are always created under the `/pages/api` directory.

It is important to note that next.js will try to create routes to every file in this directory and as such only files that are routes should be added to this directory or any of its sub-directories.

## Next-connect

The endpoints in this project have been further enhanced via the use of [next-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-connect) which adds connect style commands and middleware support.
