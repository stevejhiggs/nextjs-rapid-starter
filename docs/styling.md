# Styling

The styling system is built using [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com//).

## Cssmodule/scss support

If you don't want to use Tailwind you can just create css and scss/sass files as you normally would see [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) for details.
